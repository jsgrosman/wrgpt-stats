NOTICE:


We are now over 30 days in round "c".  Automatic
table breaking and live redraws have been disabled.
We will play until one or more tables gets below six
players.  When that happens all tables will finish
the current hand and a full redraw will occur into
the "d" round.

Players that are away from the tables 
for 45 days will be removed.
