% Sigh. Yet another hand where I fear I'm
% folding to a empty side-pot bluff. But when
% dgr did it, he ended up getting there, anyway,
% so my bad fold worked out well in the end.
% Also, my buddy Dire Wolf ended up busting him
% out, so karma won out. (Not that I should complain,
% I've been stupidly luck.) Anyway, I'm folding a 6, so
% if you were bluffing and then fail to knock out
% Joker's ace high, you've cost us all by letting someone
% stay in the tournament who should be gone.
