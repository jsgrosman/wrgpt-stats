% That's a great bluff.? Even though I have an ace, there's really no way
% I can call. If you really do have a 5, you left some money on the table
% because I probably would have bet my ace, and I definitely would have
% bluffed it if I had, say, KQs. But it's a great play either way, since
% meta-gaming is so important here.
