% Well, I was going to call him, since I don't really think that a
% back-from-AWOL push means a big pair. But since you've called, Neil, I'm
% worried that could mean you do have one (though I'll bet it's just a
% decent ace). Anyway, for the record, I'm folding 88; when the remaining
% two 8's flop, I'm going to be sad. :-)
